# Dart Null Check Operator Bug
This repository demonstrates a potential issue related to the null-aware operator (`??`) in Dart.  The `bug.dart` file contains code that might not behave as expected due to how null values are handled.
The `bugSolution.dart` provides a corrected version with explanations.

## Problem
The primary problem arises from the implicit assumption that `0` is always an acceptable default value when `_myVariable` is null.  In some cases, a different approach might be necessary to handle null values more gracefully. 

## Solution
The solution uses improved null handling techniques to avoid potential unexpected behavior.
